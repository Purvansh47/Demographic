# Demographic
R shiny Model for Demographic Details

The DM Version 1 has some back ends in which the table output gives an error

The DM Version 2 have solution for the problem given in DM Version 1 but the problem is we need to specify treatment variable as ARM (in small letters or capital letters)
then only it will work.
